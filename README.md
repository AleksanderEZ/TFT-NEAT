# TFT-NEAT
The objective of this final degree project is the adaptation of the NEAT algorithm (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies),
to train intelligent agents with the mission of completing videogame levels. This work is inspired on a previous work which
already does implement a version of the algorithm in Lua for the Nintendo NES game, Super Mario Bros. The algorithm is
implemented as a plug-in for an emulator that allows the code interact directly with the game. Once adapted the algorithm for
different games, we experiment with its parameters to see how it affects the performance of the trained agents.
Moreover, an own implementation of the algorithm is done over an own game.
